# node-rest-shop-API
This project is a Node.js based online shopping cart Restful API where users can shop products and place orders along with deleting and updating the products as well the orders. To authenticate the user, JWT has been used. MongoDB Atlas has been used for storing and working with all the data. The api has been tested using Postman.

# What is REST?
A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

# Application
It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.
